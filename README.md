# c utils

Random collection of utility things for C/C++. This mostly serves as a way to refresh my memory if I need to implement similar functionality in a project. Some things are intentionally left half-implemented so that there exists room for further interpretation/specialization.

- Allocators
- Threading
- Simple hashes and ADT
- Simple dynamic hot-reloading stuff
- crt0 stuff.
- macro
- type re-definitions
- simple logging
